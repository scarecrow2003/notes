 Security
   Design Principles
      1. Apply security at all layers
      2. Enable traceability
      3. Automate responses to security events
      4. Focus on securing your system
      5. Automate security best practices
   Four areas
      1. Data protection
      2. Privilege management
      3. Infrastructure protection
      4. Detective controls
      
  Reliability
    Design Principles
      1. Test recovery procedure
      2. Automatially recover from failure
      3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
      4. Stop guessing capacity
    Three areas
      1. Foundations
      2. Change management
      3. Failure management
      
  Performance Efficiency
    Design Principles
      1. Democratize advanced technologies
      2. Go global in minutes
      3. Use server-less architectures
      4. Experiment more often
    Four areas
      1. Compute
      2. Storage
      3. Database
      4. Space-time trade-off
      
  Cost Optimization
    Design Principles
      1. Transparently attribute expenditure
      2. Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership
      3. Trade capital expense for operating expense
      4. Benefit from economies of scale
      5. Stop spending money on data center operations
    Four areas
      1. Matched supply and demand
      2. Cost effective resources
      3. Expenditure awareness
      4. Optimizing over time
      
  Operational Excellence
    Design Principles
      1. Perform operation with code
      2. Align operations precesses to business objectives
      3. Make regular, small. incremental changes
      4. Test for responses to unexpected events
      5. Learn from operational events and failures
      6. Keep operations procedures current
    Three areas
      1. Prepration
      2. Operation
      3. Response
