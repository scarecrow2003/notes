    4. chkconfig httpd on
    5. Move volume to another AZ -- take snapshot and create volume from that snapshot
       Move volume to another Region -- take snapshot and copy to other Region
    6. EFS (Elastic File System) supports Network File System. Can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances.
    7. Role can be attached to a running EC2 instance
